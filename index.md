title: A Survey of Machine Learning for Big Code and Naturalness
---
### Machine Learning on Source Code

The billions of lines of source code that have been written contain 
implicit knowledge about how to write good code, code that is
easy to read and to debug.
A recent line of research aims to find statistical patterns in large
corpora of code to drive *new software development tools and program
analyses*.

This website and the accompanying [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182) surveys the work in this emerging area.

Like writing and speaking, software development is an act of human communication.
At its core,
the naturalness of software employs statistical modeling over big code to
reason about rich variety of programs developers write.  This new line of
research is inherently interdisciplinary, uniting the machine learning and 
natural language processing communities with software engineering
and programming language communities.

This site is an experiment: a [living literature review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_review) that allows
you explore, [search and navigate]({% link papers.html %}) the literature in this area, by
following a [taxonomy]({% link base-taxonomy/index.md %})
based on the underlying design principles of each model.
The full survey is available [as a research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182).

### Contributing

This research area is evolving so fast that a static review cannot keep up.
But a website can! We hope to make this site a living document.
Anyone can add a paper to this web site, essentially by creating one Markdown file.
