### Datasets
Some resources about Big Code and Naturalness can be found at [learnbigcode.github.io](http://learnbigcode.github.io).
A list of datasets used in this area can be found at the appendix of the
[survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182) and at [learnbigcode.github.io](http://learnbigcode.github.io/datasets/).

### Courses
A few university courses are been taught covering aspects of machine learning for code, big code or naturalnness of code. Below there are a few that have publicly available material.
* [Analyzing Software using Deep Learning](https://www.sola.tu-darmstadt.de/de/software-lab/teaching/summer-2017/analyzing-software-using-deep-learning/analyzing-software-using-deep-learning-summer-semester-2017/) in T.U. Darmstadt
* [Seminars on Applications of Deep Learning in Software Engineering and Programming Languages](https://sites.google.com/view/mlplse-sp18/) in U.C. Berkeley
* [Machine learning for programming](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1819/R252/) in the University of Cambridge, UK
* [Deep Learning for Symbolic Reasoning](http://tiarkrompf.github.io/cs590/2018/) in Purdue University
