### Datasets
Some resources about Big Code and Naturalness can be found at [learnbigcode.github.io](http://learnbigcode.github.io).
A list of datasets used in this area can be found at the appendix of the
[survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06182) and at [learnbigcode.github.io](http://learnbigcode.github.io/datasets/).

### Courses
A few university courses are been taught covering aspects of machine learning for code, big code or naturalness of code. Below there are a few that have publicly available material.
* [Analyzing Software using Deep Learning](http://software-lab.org/teaching/summer2020/asdl/) in University of Stuttgart [[videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBmY8PAxzwIHIKq4tYLws25KqGvUM4iFD)]
