### Contributing

This research area is evolving so fast that a static review cannot keep up.
But a website can! We hope to make this site a living document.
Anyone can add a paper to this web site, essentially by creating one Markdown file.
 To contribute, open a pull request in GitHub, by following [these instructions 
for contributing](contributing.markdown).
