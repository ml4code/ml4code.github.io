To accelerate software development, much research has been performed
to help people understand and reuse the huge amount of available code
resources. Two important tasks have been widely studied: code retrieval,
which aims to retrieve code snippets relevant to a given natural language
query from a code base, and code annotation, where the goal is to annotate a 
code snippet with anatural language description. Despite their advancement in recent
years, the two tasks are mostly explored separately. In this work, we
investigate a novel perspective of Code annotation for Code retrieval 
(hence called “CoaCor”), where a code annotation model is trained
to generate a natural language annotation that can represent the
semantic meaning of a given code snippet and can be leveraged by
a code retrieval model to better distinguish relevant code snippets
from others. To this end, we propose an effective framework based
on reinforcement learning, which explicitly encourages the code
annotation model to generate annotations that can be used for the
retrieval task. Through extensive experiments, we show that code
annotations generated by our framework are much more detailed
and more useful for code retrieval, and they can further improve
the performance of existing code retrieval models significantly.
