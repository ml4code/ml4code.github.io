We study the problem of building generative
models of natural source code (NSC); that is,
source code written by humans and meant to
be understood by humans. Our primary con-
tribution is to describe new generative models
that are tailored to NSC. The models are based
on probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs)
and neuro-probabilistic language models (Mnih
& Teh, 2012), which are extended to incorporate
additional source code-specific structure. These
models can be efficiently trained on a corpus
of source code and outperform a variety of less
structured baselines in terms of predictive log
likelihoods on held-out data.
