Providing feedback, both assessing final work
and giving hints to stuck students, is difficult
for open-ended assignments in massive online
classes which can range from thousands to millions of students. We introduce a neural network
method to encode programs as a linear mapping
from an embedded precondition space to an embedded postcondition space and propose an algorithm for feedback at scale using these linear maps as features. We apply our algorithm
to assessments from the Code.org Hour of Code
and Stanford University’s CS1 course, where we
propagate human comments on student assignments to orders of magnitude more submissions.
