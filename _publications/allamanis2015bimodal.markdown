We consider the problem of building probabilistic models that jointly 
model short natural language utterances and source code snippets. The
aim is to bring together recent work on statistical modelling of source
code and work on bimodal models of images and natural language. The
resulting models are useful for a variety of tasks that involve natural
language and source code. We demonstrate their performance on two
retrieval tasks: retrieving source code snippets given a natural language
query, and retrieving natural language descriptions given a source code
query (i.e., source code captioning). Experiments show there to be
promise in this direction, and that modelling the structure of source
code improves performance.
