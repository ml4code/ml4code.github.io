We consider the problem of parsing natural language descriptions into source code
written in a general-purpose programming
language like Python. Existing data-driven methods treat this problem as a language generation task without considering
the underlying syntax of the target programming language. Informed by previous work in semantic parsing, in this paper we propose a novel neural architecture
powered by a grammar model to explicitly
capture the target syntax as prior knowledge. Experiments find this an effective
way to scale up to generation of complex
programs from natural language descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art results that
well outperform previous code generation
and semantic parsing approaches.
