Recent  state-of-the-art  approaches  automatically  generate
regular  expressions  from  natural  language  specifications.
Given that these approaches use only synthetic data in both
training datasets and validation/test datasets, a natural question arises: are these approaches effective to address various
real-world  situations?  To  explore  this  question,  in  this  paper, we conduct a characteristic study on comparing two synthetic datasets used by the recent research and a real-world
dataset  collected  from  the  Internet,  and  conduct  an  experimental study on applying a state-of-the-art approach on the
real-world dataset. Our study results suggest the existence of
distinct characteristics between the synthetic datasets and the
real-world  dataset,  and  the  state-of-the-art  approach  (based
on  a  model  trained  from  a  synthetic  dataset)  achieves  extremely low effectiveness when evaluated on real-world data,
much lower than the effectiveness when evaluated on the synthetic  dataset.  We  also  provide  initial  analysis  on  some  of
those challenging cases and discuss future directions.
