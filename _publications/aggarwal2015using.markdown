In this paper, we have tried to use Statistical machine translation in order to convert Python 2 code to Python 3 code. We use data from two projects and achieve a high BLEU score. We also investigate the cross-project training and testing to analyze the errors so as to ascertain differences with previous case. We have described a pilot study on modeling programming languages as natural language to build translation models on the lines of natural languages. This can be further worked on to translate between versions of a programming language or cross-programming-languages code translation.
