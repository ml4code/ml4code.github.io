Learning programs is a timely and interesting challenge. In Programming by Example
(PBE), a system attempts to infer a program
from input and output examples alone, by
searching for a composition of some set of
base functions. We show how machine learning can be used to speed up this seemingly
hopeless search problem, by learning weights
that relate textual features describing the
provided input-output examples to plausible
sub-components of a program. This generic
learning framework lets us address problems
beyond the scope of earlier PBE systems.
Experiments on a prototype implementation
show that learning improves search and ranking on a variety of text processing tasks found
on help forums.
