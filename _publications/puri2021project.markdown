Advancements in deep learning and machine learning algorithms have enabled
breakthrough progress in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language
processing and beyond.  In addition, over the last several decades, software has
been built into the fabric of every aspect of our society.   Together,  these two
trends have generated new interest in the fast-emerging research area of “AI for
Code”. As software development becomes ubiquitous across all industries and code
infrastructure of enterprise legacy applications ages, it is more critical than ever
to increase software development productivity and modernize legacy applications.
Over the last decade, datasets like ImageNet, with its large scale and diversity,
have played a pivotal role in algorithmic advancements from computer vision to
language and speech understanding. In this paper, we present "Project CodeNet",
a first-of-its-kind, very large scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset to accelerate
the algorithmic advancements in AI for Code.  It consists of 14M code samples
and about 500M lines of code in 55 different programming languages.  Project
CodeNet is not only unique in its scale, but also in the diversity of coding tasks
it can help benchmark:  from code similarity and classification for advances in
code recommendation algorithms, and code translation between a large variety
programming languages, to advances in code performance (both runtime, and
memory) improvement techniques. CodeNet also provides sample input and output
test sets for over 7M code samples, which can be critical for determining code
equivalence in different languages. As a usability feature, we provide several 
preprocessing tools in Project CodeNet to transform source codes into representations
that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models.
