Statistical language models have successfully been used to describe and analyze
natural language documents. Recent work
applying language models to programming languages is focused on the task
of predicting code, while mainly ignoring
the prediction of programmer comments.
In this work, we predict comments from
JAVA source files of open source projects,
using topic models and n-grams, and we
analyze the performance of the models
given varying amounts of background data
on the project being predicted. We evaluate models on their comment-completion
capability in a setting similar to code completion tools built into standard code
editors, and show that using a comment
completion tool can save up to 47% of the
comment typing.
