Semantic feature learning for natural language and programming language is a preliminary step in addressing many software mining tasks. Many existing methods leverage
information in lexicon and syntax to learn features for textual data.
However, such information is inadequate to represent the entire semantics in either text sentence or code snippet. This
motivates us to propose a new approach to learn semantic
features for both languages, through extracting three levels of
information, namely global, local and sequential information,
from textual data. For tasks involving both modalities, we
project the data of both types into a uniform feature space so
that the complementary knowledge in between can be utilized
in their representation. In this paper, we build a novel and
general-purpose feature learning framework called UniEmbed, to uniformly learn comprehensive semantic representation for both natural language and programming language.
Experimental results on three real-world software mining
tasks show that UniEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art models in feature learning and prove the capacity and effectiveness of our model.
