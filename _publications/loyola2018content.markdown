We propose to study the generation of descriptions from source code changes by integrating  the  messages  included  on  code
commits and the intra-code documentation
inside the source in the form of docstrings.
Our hypothesis is that although both types
of descriptions are not directly aligned in
semantic terms —one explaining a change
and  the  other  the  actual  functionality  of
the code being modified— there could be
certain common ground that is useful for
the  generation.   To  this  end,  we  propose
an architecture that uses the source code-docstring relationship to guide the description generation.  We discuss the results of
the approach comparing against a baseline
based  on  a  sequence-to-sequence  model,
using standard automatic natural language
generation metrics as well as with a human
study, thus offering a comprehensive view
of the feasibility of the approach.
