Deep learning has made significant breakthroughs
in various fields of artificial intelligence. Advantages of deep
learning include the ability to capture highly complicated features, weak involvement of human engineering, etc. However,
it is still virtually impossible to use deep learning to analyze
programs since deep architectures cannot be trained effectively
with pure back propagation. In this pioneering paper, we propose
the “coding criterion” to build program vector representations,
which are the premise of deep learning for program analysis. Our
representation learning approach directly makes deep learning a
reality in this new field. We evaluate the learned vector representations both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conclude, based
on the experiments, the coding criterion is successful in building
program representations. To evaluate whether deep learning
is beneficial for program analysis, we feed the representations
to deep neural networks, and achieve higher accuracy in the
program classification task than “shallow” methods, such as
logistic regression and the support vector machine. This result
confirms the feasibility of deep learning to analyze programs. It
also gives primary evidence of its success in this new field. We
believe deep learning will become an outstanding technique for
program analysis in the near future.
