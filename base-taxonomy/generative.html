          <td><p>The tens of thousands of high-quality open source software projects on the Internet raise the exciting possibility of studying software development by finding patterns across truly large source code repositories. This could enable new tools for developing code, encouraging reuse, and navigating large projects. In this paper, we build the first giga-token probabilistic language model of source code, based on 352 million lines of Java. This is 100 times the scale of the pioneering work by Hindle et al. The giga-token model is significantly better at the code suggestion task than previous models. More broadly, our approach provides a new “lens” for analyzing software projects, enabling new complexity metrics based on statistical analysis of large corpora. We call these metrics data-driven complexity metrics. We propose new metrics that measure the complexity of a code module and the topical centrality of a module to a software project. In particular, it is possible to distinguish reusable utility classes from classes that are part of a program’s core logic based solely on general information theoretic criteria.</p>

about identifier naming to preferences about object relationships and
design patterns. Coding conventions define a consistent syntactic style,
fostering readability and hence maintainability. When collaborating,
programmers strive to obey a project’s coding conventions. However,
one third of reviews of changes contain feedback about coding conventions,
indicating that programmers do not always follow them and that project
members care deeply about adherence. Unfortunately, programmers are
often unaware of coding conventions because inferring them requires a
global view, one that aggregates the many local decisions programmers
make and identifies emergent consensus on style. We present Naturalize,
a framework that learns the style of a codebase, and suggests revisions
to improve stylistic consistency. Naturalize builds on recent work in
applying statistical natural language processing to source code. We
apply Naturalize to suggest natural identifier names and formatting
conventions. We present four tools focused on ensuring natural code
during development and release management, including code review.
Naturalize achieves 94% accuracy in its top suggestions for identifier
names. We used Naturalize to generate 18 patches for 5 open source
projects: 14 were accepted.</p>

We take the view that a code idiom is a syntactic fragment that recurs across projects and has a single semantic purpose. Idioms may have metavariables, such as the body of a for loop. Modern IDEs commonly provide facilities for manually defining idioms and inserting them on demand, but this does not help programmers to write idiomatic code in languages or using libraries with which they are unfamiliar. We present Haggis, a system for mining code idioms that builds on recent advanced techniques from statistical natural language processing, namely, nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic tree substitution grammars. We apply Haggis to several of the most popular open source projects from GitHub. We present a wide range of evidence that the resulting idioms are semantically meaningful, demonstrating that they do indeed recur across software projects and that they occur more frequently in illustrative code examples collected from a Q&amp;A site. Manual examination of the most common idioms indicate that they describe important program concepts, including object creation, exception handling, and resource management.</p>

promise in this direction, and that modelling the structure of source

Trained only on sequences from a known grammar, though, they can still struggle to learn rules and constraints of the grammar. Neural Attribute Machines (NAMs) are equipped with a logical machine that represents the underlying grammar, which is used to teach the constraints to the neural machine by (i) augmenting the input sequence, and (ii) optimizing a custom loss function. Unlike traditional RNNs, NAMs are exposed to the grammar, as well as samples from the language of the grammar. During generation, NAMs make significantly fewer violations of the constraints of the underlying grammar than RNNs trained only on samples from the language of the grammar.</p>

          <td><p>We present a method for automatically generating repair feedback for syntax errors for introductory programming problems. Syntax errors constitute one of the largest classes of errors (34%) in our dataset of student submissions obtained from a MOOC course on edX. The previous techniques for generating automated feedback on programming assignments have focused on functional correctness and style considerations of student programs. These techniques analyze the program AST of the program and then perform some dynamic and symbolic analyses to compute repair feedback. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generate ASTs for student programs with syntax errors and therefore the previous feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing syntax errors. We present a technique for providing feedback on syntax errors that uses Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model syntactically valid token sequences. Our approach is inspired from the recent work on learning language models from Big Code (large code corpus). For a given programming assignment, we first learn an RNN to model all valid token sequences using the set of syntactically correct student submissions. Then, for a student submission with
syntax errors, we query the learnt RNN model with the prefix token sequence to predict token sequences that can fix the error by either replacing or inserting the predicted token sequence at the error location. We evaluate our technique on over 14, 000 student submissions with syntax errors. Our technique can completely repair 31.69% (4501/14203) of submissions with syntax errors and in addition partially correct 6.39% (908/14203) of the submissions.</p>

          <td>Code Completion</td>
          <td><p>To enhance developer productivity, all modern integrated development environments (IDEs) include code suggestion functionality that proposes likely next tokens at the cursor. While current IDEs work well for statically-typed languages, their reliance on type annotations means that they do not provide the same level of support for dynamic programming languages as for statically-typed languages. Moreover, suggestion engines in modern IDEs do not propose expressions or multi-statement idiomatic code. Recent work has shown that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long-range dependencies. We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past.</p>

Even though PHOG is more powerful than a PCFG, it can be learned from data just as efficiently. We trained a PHOG model on a large JavaScript code corpus and show that it is more precise than existing models, while similarly fast. As a result, PHOG can immediately benefit existing programming tools based on probabilistic models of code.</p>

          <td><p>A frustrating aspect of software development is that compiler error messages often fail to locate the actual cause of a syntax error. An errant semicolon or brace can result in
many errors reported throughout the file. We seek to find the actual source of these syntax errors by relying on the consistency of software: valid source code is usually repetitive and unsurprising. We exploit this consistency by constructing a simple N-gram language model of lexed source code tokens. We implemented an automatic Java syntax-error locator using the corpus of the project itself and evaluated its performance on mutated source code from several projects. Our tool, trained on the past versions of a project, can effectively augment the syntax error locations produced by the native compiler. Thus we provide a methodology and tool that exploits the naturalness of software source code to detect syntax errors alongside the parser.</p>

be used to capture knowledge about development practice or about a software project itself. Thus, extracting the content of developers’ communication can be useful to support
several software engineering tasks, such as program comprehension, source code analysis, and software analytics. However, automating the extraction process is challenging, due to the unstructured nature of free text, which mixes different coding languages (e.g., source code, stack dumps, and log traces) with natural language parts.</p>

<p>We conduct an extensive evaluation of Irish (InfoRmation ISlands Hmm), an approach we proposed to extract islands of coded information from free text at token granularity, with respect to the state of art approaches based on island parsing or island parsing combined with machine learners. The evaluation considers a wide set of natural language documents (e.g., textbooks, forum discussions, and development emails) taken from different contexts and encompassing different coding languages. Results indicate an F-measure of Irish between 74% and 99%; this is in line with existing approaches which, differently from Irish, require specific expertise for the definition of regular expressions or grammars.</p>

          <td><p>Predictive modeling using machine learning is an effective method for building compiler heuristics, but there is a shortage of benchmarks. Typical machine learning experiments outside of the compilation field train over thousands or millions of examples. In machine learning for compilers, however, there are typically only a few dozen common benchmarks available. This limits the quality of learned models, as they have very sparse training data for what are often high-dimensional feature spaces. What is needed is a way to generate an unbounded number of training programs that finely cover the feature space. At the same time the generated programs must be similar to the types of programs that human developers actually write, otherwise the learning will target the wrong parts of the feature space. We mine open source repositories for program fragments and apply deep learning techniques to automatically construct models for how humans write programs. We sample these models to generate an unbounded number of runnable training programs. The quality of the programs is such that even human developers struggle to distinguish our generated programs from hand-written code. We use our generator for OpenCL programs, CLgen, to automatically synthesize thousands of programs and show that learning over these improves the performance of a state of the art predictive model by 1.27x. In addition, the fine covering of the feature space automatically exposes weaknesses in the feature design which are invisible with the sparse training examples from existing benchmark suites. Correcting these weaknesses further increases performance by 4.30x.</p>

the design and implementation of a robust natural language
based interface to spreadsheet programming. Our methodology involves designing a typed domain-specific language
(DSL) that supports an expressive algebra of map, filter, reduce, join, and formatting capabilities at a level of abstraction appropriate for non-expert users. The key algorithmic
component of our methodology is a translation algorithm
for converting a natural language specification in the context of a given spreadsheet to a ranked set of likely programs
in the DSL. The translation algorithm leverages the spreadsheet spatial and temporal context to assign interpretations
to specifications with implicit references, and is thus robust
to a variety of ways in which end users can express the same
task. The translation algorithm builds over ideas from keyword programming and semantic parsing to achieve both
high precision and high recall. We implemented the system
as an Excel add-in called NLyze that supports a rich user
interaction model including annotating the user’s natural
language specification and explaining the synthesized DSL
programs by paraphrasing them into structured English. We
collected a total of 3570 English descriptions for 40 spreadsheet tasks and our system was able to generate the intended

As part of our system we have constructed a probabilistic context free grammar for Java constructs and library invocations, as well as an algorithm that uses a customized natural language processing tool chain to extract information from free-form text queries. We present the results on a number of examples showing that our technique (1) often produces the expected code fragments, (2) tolerates much of the flexibility of natural language, and (3) can repair incorrect Java expressions that use, for example, the wrong syntax or missing arguments.</p>

Avvaiyar, can certainly delight and inspire. But in practice,
given cognitive constraints and the exigencies of daily life, most
human utterances are far simpler and much more repetitive
and predictable. In fact, these utterances can be very usefully
modeled using modern statistical methods. This fact has led
to the phenomenal success of statistical approaches to speech
recognition, natural language translation, question-answering,
and text mining and comprehension.</p>

<p>We begin with the conjecture that most software is also
natural, in the sense that it is created by humans at work,
with all the attendant constraints and limitations—and thus,
like natural language, it is also likely to be repetitive and
predictable. We then proceed to ask whether a) code can
be usefully modeled by statistical language models and b)
such models can be leveraged to support software engineers.
Using the widely adopted n-gram model, we provide empirical
evidence supportive of a positive answer to both these questions.
We show that code is also very repetitive, and in fact even more
so than natural languages. As an example use of the model,
we have developed a simple code completion engine for Java
that, despite its simplicity, already improves Eclipse’s built-in
completion capability. We conclude the paper by laying out a
vision for future research in this area.</p>

analysis techniques (e.g., finding data and control dependencies) are useful, but do not say how surprising or common
a line of code is. Natural language processing researchers
have encountered a similar problem and addressed it using
an n-gram model of text frequency, derived from statistics
computed over text corpora.</p>

<p>We propose and compute an n-gram model for programming languages, computed over a corpus of 2.8 million
JavaScript programs we downloaded from the Web. In contrast to previous techniques, we describe a code n-gram as
a subgraph of the program dependence graph that contains
all nodes and edges reachable in n steps from the statement.
We can count n-grams in a program and count the frequency
of n-grams in the corpus, enabling us to compute tf-idf-style
measures that capture the differing importance of different
lines of code. We demonstrate the power of this approach by
implementing a plagiarism detector with accuracy that beats
previous techniques, and a bug-finding tool that discovered
over a dozen previously unknown bugs in a collection of real
deployed programs.</p>

Towards that, we investigated several variants of the phrase-based
translation approach: i) a direct application of the approach to
programming languages, ii) a novel modification of the approach
to incorporate the grammatical structure of the target programming
language (so to avoid generating target programs which do not
parse), and iii) a combination of ii) with custom rules added to
improve the quality of the translation.</p>

<p>To experiment with the above systems, we investigated machine
translation from C# to Java. For the training, which takes about
60 hours, we used a parallel corpus of 20, 499 C#-to-Java method
translations. We then evaluated each of the three systems above by
translating 1,000 C# methods. Our experimental results indicate
that with the most advanced system, about 60% of the translated
methods compile (the top ranked) and out of a random sample of 50
correctly compiled methods, 68% (34 methods) were semantically
equivalent to the reference solution.</p>

does the translation using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a
state-of-the-art natural language processing technique that we augmented with slot (argument) filling and other enhancements.</p>

Tellina’s RNNs on textual descriptions of file system operations

(SMT) models for natural languages could help in migrating source code from one programming language to another.
We treat source code as a sequence of lexical tokens and
apply a phrase-based SMT model on the lexemes of those
tokens. Our empirical evaluation on migrating two Java
projects into C# showed that lexical, phrase-based SMT
could achieve high lexical translation accuracy ( BLEU from
81.3-82.6%). Users would have to manually edit only 11.9-15.8% of the total number of tokens in the resulting code to
correct it. However, a high percentage of total translation
methods (49.5-58.6%) is syntactically incorrect. Therefore,
our result calls for a more program-oriented SMT model that
is capable of better integrating the syntactic and semantic
information of a program to support language migration.</p>

capture source code regularities/patterns is based only on
the lexical information in a local context of the code units.
To improve predictability, we introduce SLAMC, a novel statistical semantic language model for source code. It incorporates semantic information into code tokens and models the
regularities/patterns of such semantic annotations, called sememes, rather than their lexemes. It combines the local context in semantic n-grams with the global technical concerns/functionality into an n-gram topic model, together with pairwise associations of program elements. Based on SLAMC,
we developed a new code suggestion method, which is empirically evaluated on several projects to have relatively 18–68%

much semantically incorrect code. A key limitation is the use of
sequences in phrase-based SMT to model and translate source
code with well-formed structures. We propose mppSMT, a divideand-conquer technique to address that with novel training and migration algorithms using phrase-based SMT in three phases. First,
mppSMT treats a program as a sequence of syntactic units and
maps/translates such sequences in two languages to one another.
Second, with a syntax-directed fashion, it deals with the tokens
within syntactic units by encoding them with semantic symbols to
represent their data and token types. This encoding via semantic
symbols helps better migration of API usages. Third, the lexical
tokens corresponding to each sememe are mapped or migrated.
The resulting sequences of tokens are merged together to form
the final migrated code. Such divide-and-conquer and syntax-direction strategies enable phrase-based SMT to adapt well to
syntactical structures in source code, thus, improving migration
accuracy. Our empirical evaluation on several real-world systems
shows that 84.8–97.9% and 70–83% of the migrated methods are
syntactically and semantically correct, respectively. 26.3–51.2%
of total migrated methods are exactly matched to the human-written C# code in the oracle. Compared to Java2CSharp, a rule-based migration tool, it achieves higher semantic accuracy from
6.6–57.7% relatively. Importantly, it does not require manual

new data with properties similar to the corpus. To support a
wide range of different properties, TreeFuzz is designed as a
framework with an extensible set of techniques to infer generative models. We apply the idea to JavaScript programs

only 2.06 validation errors per kilobyte of generated HTML.
The performance of both learning and generation scales linearly w.r.t. the size of the corpus. Using TreeFuzz-generated

<p>The key observation is that in MOOCs many programs share similar code fragments, and the seq2seq neural network model, used in the natural-language processing task of machine translation, can be modified and trained to recover these fragments.</p>

On the benchmark Hearthstone dataset for code generation, our model obtains 79.2 BLEU and 22.7% exact match accuracy, compared to previous state-of-the-art values of 67.1 and 6.1%.

          <td><p>Real software, the kind working programmers produce by the kLOC
to solve real-world problems, tends to be “natural”, like speech or
natural language; it tends to be highly repetitive and predictable.
Researchers have captured this naturalness of software through statistical models and used them to good effect in suggestion engines,
porting tools, coding standards checkers, and idiom miners. This
suggests that code that appears improbable, or surprising, to a good
statistical language model is “unnatural” in some sense, and thus
possibly suspicious. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis. We consider a large corpus of bug fix commits (ca. 8,296),
from 10 different Java projects, and we focus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and the corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic
(i.e. unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Focusing on
highly entropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug finders (PMD, FindBugs) and ordering warnings
from these bug finders using an entropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated in warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid language-independent and simple
way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and
that search-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for fault-localization and searching for fixes.</p>

extracts sequences of method calls from a large codebase, and

the language model to find the highest ranked sentences, and use
them to synthesize a code completion. Our approach is able to
synthesize sequences of calls across multiple objects together with
their arguments.</p>

          <td><p>We present a new approach for learning programs from noisy
datasets. Our approach is based on two new concepts: a regularized
program generator which produces a candidate program based on a
small sample of the entire dataset while avoiding overfitting, and a
dataset sampler which carefully samples the dataset by leveraging
the candidate program’s score on that dataset. The two components
are connected in a continuous feedback-directed loop.</p>

<p>We show how to apply this approach to two settings: one where
the dataset has a bound on the noise, and another without a noise
bound. The second setting leads to a new way of performing
approximate empirical risk minimization on hypotheses classes
formed by a discrete search space.</p>

<p>We then present two new kinds of program synthesizers which
target the two noise settings. First, we introduce a novel regularized
bitstream synthesizer that successfully generates programs even in
the presence of incorrect examples. We show that the synthesizer
can detect errors in the examples while combating overfitting –
a major problem in existing synthesis techniques. We also show
how the approach can be used in a setting where the dataset grows
dynamically via new examples (e.g., provided by a human).</p>

<p>Second, we present a novel technique for constructing statistical
code completion systems. These are systems trained on massive
datasets of open source programs, also known as “Big Code”. The
key idea is to introduce a domain specific language (DSL) over
trees and to learn functions in that DSL directly from the dataset.
These learned functions then condition the predictions made by the
system. This is a flexible and powerful technique which generalizes
several existing works as we no longer need to decide a priori on
what the prediction should be conditioned (another benefit is that
the learned functions are a natural mechanism for explaining the
prediction). As a result, our code completion system surpasses the
prediction capabilities of existing, hard-wired systems.</p>

(NLP) techniques applied to source code such as n-gram language
models show great promise in areas such as code completion, aiding impaired developers, and code search. In this paper, we address
three questions related to different methods of constructing lan-
guage models in an industrial context. Specifically, we ask: (1) Do
application specific, but smaller language models perform better
than language models across applications? (2) Are developer specific language models effective and do they differ depending on
what parts of the codebase a developer is working in? (3) Finally,
do language models change over time, i.e., does a language model
from early development model change later on in development?
The answers to these questions enable techniques that make use of
programming language models in development to choose the model
training corpus more effectively.</p>

<p>We evaluate these questions by building 28 language models across
developers, time periods, and applications within Microsoft Office
and present the results in this paper. We find that developer and
application specific language models perform better than models
from the entire codebase, but that temporality has little to no effect
on language model performance.</p>

          <td><p>Twitter is one of the most widely used social media
platforms today. It enables users to share and view short 140-character messages called “tweets”. About 284 million active
users generate close to 500 million tweets per day. Such rapid
generation of user generated content in large magnitudes results
in the problem of information overload. Users who are interested
in information related to a particular domain have limited means
to filter out irrelevant tweets and tend to get lost in the huge
amount of data they encounter. A recent study by Singer et
al. found that software developers use Twitter to stay aware of
industry trends, to learn from others, and to network with other
developers. However, Singer et al. also reported that developers
often find Twitter streams to contain too much noise which is a
barrier to the adoption of Twitter. In this paper, to help developers
cope with noise, we propose a novel approach named NIRMAL,
which automatically identifies software relevant tweets from a
collection or stream of tweets. Our approach is based on language
modeling which learns a statistical model based on a training
corpus (i.e., set of documents). We make use of a subset of posts
from StackOverflow, a programming question and answer site, as
a training corpus to learn a language model. A corpus of tweets
was then used to test the effectiveness of the trained language
model. The tweets were sorted based on the rank the model
assigned to each of the individual tweets. The top 200 tweets
were then manually analyzed to verify whether they are software
related or not, and then an accuracy score was calculated. The
results show that decent accuracy scores can be achieved by
various variants of NIRMAL, which indicates that NIRMAL can
effectively identify software related tweets from a huge corpus of
tweets.</p>

language processing, has been shown to successfully capture the
repetitive and predictable regularities (“naturalness”) of source code,
and help with tasks such as code suggestion, porting, and designing
assistive coding devices. However, we show in this paper that this
natural-language-based model fails to exploit a special property of
source code: localness. We find that human-written programs are
localized: they have useful local regularities that can be captured
and exploited. We introduce a novel cache language model that
consists of both an n-gram and an added “cache” component to
exploit localness. We show empirically that the additional cache
component greatly improves the n-gram approach by capturing
the localness of software, as measured by both cross-entropy and
suggestion accuracy. Our model’s suggestion accuracy is actually
comparable to a state-of-the-art, semantically augmented language
model; but it is simpler and easier to implement. Our cache language
model requires nothing beyond lexicalization, and thus is applicable
to all programming languages.</p>

In this paper, we describe an approach based on statistical machine translation (SMT) that recovers some of the original names from the JavaScript programs minified by the very popular UglifyJS. This simple tool, Autonym, performs comparably to the best currently available deobfuscator for JavaScript, JSNice, which uses sophisticated static analysis. In fact, Autonym is quite complementary to JSNice, performing well when it does not, and vice versa. We also introduce a new tool, JSNaughty, which blends Autonym and JSNice, and significantly outperforms both at identifier name recovery, while remaining just as easy to use as JSNice.

models to generalize well has ushered in tremendous advances
in many fields such as natural language processing (NLP).
Recent research in the software engineering (SE) community
has demonstrated the usefulness of applying NLP techniques to
software corpora. Hence, we motivate deep learning for software
language modeling, highlighting fundamental differences between
state-of-the-practice software language models and connectionist
models. Our deep learning models are applicable to source
code files (since they only require lexically analyzed source
code written in any programming language) and other types
of artifacts. We show how a particular deep learning model
can remember its state to effectively model sequential data,
e.g., streaming software tokens, and the state is shown to be
much more expressive than discrete tokens in a prefix. Then we
instantiate deep learning models and show that deep learning
induces high-quality models compared to n-grams and cache-based n-grams on a corpus of Java projects. We experiment
with two of the models’ hyperparameters, which govern their
capacity and the amount of context they use to inform predictions,
before building several committees of software language models
to aid generalization. Then we apply the deep learning models to
code suggestion and demonstrate their effectiveness at a real SE
task compared to state-of-the-practice models. Finally, we propose
avenues for future work, where deep learning can be brought to
bear to support model-based testing, improve software lexicons,
and conceptualize software artifacts. Thus, our work serves as
the first step toward deep learning software repositories.</p>
