We leverage the huge corpus of mostly correct code available on Github, and the massive, efficient learning capacity of Transformer-based NN architectures.

The approach combines a lightweight, token-based static analysis with an auto-encoder\nneural network that summarizes usage contexts and a recurrent neural network that predict natural names for a given\nusage context. We evaluate Context2Name\nwith a large corpus of real-world JavaScript code and show that it successfully predicts 60.4% of all minified identifiers. A comparison\nwith the state-of-the-art tools JSNice and JSNaughty shows\nthat our approach predicts 17% and 43% more names than the\nbest existing approaches, while taking only 2.6 milliseconds\nto predict a name, on average.</p>\n", "tags": ["naming"] },

While in the long-term they are very useful to developers, many modern APIs have an incredibly steep learning curve, due to their hundreds of functions handling many arguments, obscure documentation, and frequently changing semantics. For APIs that perform data transformations, novices can often provide an I/O example demonstrating the desired transformation, but may be stuck on how to translate it to the API. A programming-by-example synthesis engine that takes such I/O examples and directly produces programs in the target API could help such novices. Such an engine presents unique challenges due to the breadth of real-world APIs, and the often-complex constraints over function arguments. We present a generator-based synthesis approach to contend with these problems. This approach uses a program candidate generator, which encodes basic constraints on the space of programs. We introduce neural-backed operators which can be seamlessly integrated into the program generator. To improve the efficiency of the search, we simply use these operators at non-deterministic decision points, instead of relying on domain-specific heuristics. We implement this technique for the Python pandas library in AutoPandas. AutoPandas supports 119 pandas dataframe transformation functions.

Most works attempt to process the code directly or use a syntactic tree representation, treating it like sentences written in a natural language. However, none of the existing methods are sufficient to comprehend program semantics robustly, due to structural features such as function calls, branching, and interchangeable order of statements. In this paper, we propose a novel processing technique to learn code semantics, and apply it to a variety of program analysis tasks. In particular, we stipulate that a robust distributional hypothesis of code applies to both human- and machine-generated programs. Following this hypothesis, we define an embedding space, inst2vec, based on an Intermediate Representation (IR) of the code that is independent of the source programming language. We provide a novel definition of contextual flow for this IR, leveraging both the underlying data- and control-flow of the program. We then analyze the embeddings qualitatively using analogies and clustering, and evaluate the learned representation on three different high-level tasks. We show that with a single RNN architecture and pre-trained fixed embeddings, inst2vec outperforms specialized approaches for performance prediction (compute device mapping, optimal thread coarsening); and algorithm classification from raw code (104 classes), where we set a new state-of-the-art.</p>\n", "tags": ["representation"] },

These techniques analyze the program AST of the program and then perform some dynamic and symbolic analyses to compute repair feedback. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generate ASTs for student programs with syntax errors and therefore the previous feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing syntax errors.

While some techniques produce representations from unlabeled code, they are far from satisfactory when applied to downstream tasks. Although certain techniques generate representations from unlabeled code when applied to downstream tasks they are far from satisfactory. This paper proposes InferCode to overcome the limitation by adapting the self-supervised learning mechanism to build source code model. The key novelty lies in training code representations by predicting automatically identified subtrees from the context of the ASTs. Subtrees in ASTs are treated with InferCode as the labels for training code representations without any human labeling effort or the overhead of expensive graph construction, and the trained representations are no longer tied to any specific downstream tasks or code units. We trained an InferCode model instance using the Tree-based CNN as the encoder of a large set of Java code and applied it to downstream unsupervised tasks such as code clustering, code clone detection, cross-language code search or reused under a transfer learning scheme to continue training the model weights for supervised tasks such as code classification and method name prediction. Compared to previous code learning techniques applied to the same downstream tasks, such as Code2Vec, Code2Seq, ASTNN, higher performance results are achieved using our pre-trained InferCode model with a significant margin for most tasks including those involving different programming languages.</p>\n", "tags": ["representation"] },

Our technique automates this feature design process. The idea is to use programs as features after reducing and abstracting them. Our technique goes through selected program-query pairs in codebases, and it reduces and abstracts the program in each pair to a few lines of code, while ensuring that the analysis behaves similarly for the original and the new programs with respect to the query. Each reduced program serves as a boolean feature for program-query pairs. This feature evaluates to true for a given program-query pair when (as a program) it is included in the program part of the pair.

Existing program analysis techniques either suffer from high false positives or false negatives. Recent progress in Deep Learning (DL) has resulted in a surge of interest in applying DL for automated vulnerability detection. Several recent studies have demonstrated promising results achieving an accuracy of up to 95% at detecting vulnerabilities. In this paper, we ask, “how well do the state-of-the-art DL-based techniques perform in a real-world vulnerability prediction scenario?”. To our surprise, we find that their performance drops by more than 50%. A systematic investigation of what causes such precipitous performance drop reveals that existing DL-based vulnerability prediction approaches suffer from challenges with the training data (e.g., data duplication, unrealistic distribution of vulnerable classes, etc.) and with the model choices (e.g., simple token-based models). As a result, these approaches often do not learn features related to the actual cause of the vulnerabilities. Instead, they learn unrelated artifacts from the dataset (e.g., specific variable/function names, etc.). Leveraging these empirical findings, we demonstrate how a more principled approach to data collection and model design, based on realistic settings of vulnerability prediction, can lead to better solutions. The resulting tools perform significantly better than the studied baseline: up to 33.57% boost in precision and 128.38% boost in recall compared to the best performing model in the literature.

However, many standard ML approaches require a numeric representation of data and cannot be applied directly to source code. Thus, to enable ML, we need to embed source code into numeric feature vectors while maintaining the semantics of the code as much as possible. code2vec is a recently released embedding approach that uses the proxy task of method name prediction to map Java methods to feature vectors. However, experimentation with code2vec shows that it learns to rely on variable names for prediction, causing it to be easily fooled by typos or adversarial attacks. Moreover, it is only able to embed individual Java methods and cannot embed an entire collection of methods such as those present in a typical Java class, making it difficult to perform predictions at the class level (e.g., for the identification of malicious Java classes). Both shortcomings are addressed in the research presented in this paper.

Reasoning over such a vocabulary is not something for which most NLP methods are designed. We introduce a Graph-Structured Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code. We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based models for supervised learning on code improves the models’ performance on a code completion task and a variable naming task — with over 100% relative improvement on the latter — at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time.</p>\n", "tags": ["GNN","variable misuse","defect","representation"] },

An assembly clone search engine facilitates the work of reverse engineers by identifying those duplicated or known parts. However, it is challenging to design a robust clone search engine, since there exist various compiler optimization options and code obfuscation techniques that make logically similar assembly functions appear to be very different. A practical clone search engine relies on a robust vector representation of assembly code. However, the existing clone search approaches, which rely on a manual feature engineering process to form a feature vector for an assembly function, fail to consider the relationships between features and identify those unique patterns that can statistically distinguish assembly functions. To address this problem, we propose to jointly learn the lexical semantic relationships and the vector representation of assembly functions based on assembly code.

First, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K repositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute tests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that are covered by passing tests.

In this work we introduce DeepDebug: a data-driven program repair approach which learns to detect and fix bugs in Java methods mined from real-world GitHub repositories. We frame bug-patching as a sequence-to-sequence learning task consisting of two steps: (i) denoising pretraining, and (ii) supervised finetuning on the target translation task.

Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret.

Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior with performance compared to baseline approaches.

We carefully examine the underlying assumption here: that the task of generating comments sufficiently resembles the task of translating between natural languages, and so similar models and evaluation metrics could be used. We analyze several recent code-comment datasets for this task: CodeNN, DeepCom, FunCom, and DocString.

In this work, we bridge this divide between global and structured models by introducing two new hybrid model families that are both global and incorporate structural bias: Graph Sandwiches, which wrap traditional (gated) graph message-passing layers in sequential message-passing layers; and Graph Relational Embedding Attention Transformers (GREAT for short), which bias traditional Transformers with relational information from graph edge types. By studying a popular, non-trivial program repair task, variable-misuse identification, we explore the relative merits of traditional and hybrid model families for code representation. Starting with a  graph-based model that already improves upon the prior state-of-the-art for this task by 20%, we show that our proposed hybrid models improve an additional 10-15%, while training both faster and using fewer parameters.</p>\n", "tags": ["variable misuse","defect","GNN","Transformer"] },

Most of them are based on heuristics and have certain limitations (e.g., they depend on the selection of metrics and manually-defined thresholds). In this paper, we propose an approach to recommend Move Method refactoring based on a path-based representation of code called code2vec that is able to capture the syntactic structure and semantic information of a code fragment.

Transcompilers are primarily used for interoperability, and to port codebases written in an obsolete or deprecated language (e.g. COBOL, Python 2) to a modern one. They typically rely on handcrafted rewrite rules, applied to the source code abstract syntax tree. Unfortunately, the resulting translations often lack readability, fail to respect the target language conventions, and require manual modifications in order to work properly. The overall translation process is timeconsuming and requires expertise in both the source and target languages, making code-translation projects expensive. Although neural models significantly outperform their rule-based counterparts in the context of natural language translation, their applications to transcompilation have been limited due to the scarcity of parallel data in this domain. In this paper, we propose to leverage recent approaches in unsupervised machine translation to train a fully unsupervised neural transcompiler. We train our model on source code from open source GitHub projects, and show that it can translate functions between C++, Java, and Python with high accuracy. Our method relies exclusively on monolingual source code, requires no expertise in the source or target languages, and can easily be generalized to other programming languages.

Also, previous studies suggested the existence of a relationship between code quality and its naturalness, presenting empirical evidence showing that buggy code is “less natural” than non-buggy code. We conjecture that this qualitynaturalness relationship could be exploited to support refactoring activities (e.g., to locate source code areas in need of refactoring). We perform a first step in this direction by analyzing whether refactoring can improve the naturalness of code. We use state-of-the-art tools to mine a large dataset of refactoring operations performed in open source systems. Then, we investigate the impact of different types of refactoring operations on the naturalness of the impacted code. We found that (i) code refactoring does not necessarily increase the naturalness of the refactored code; and (ii) the impact on the code naturalness strongly depends on the type of refactoring operations.</p>\n", "tags": ["language model","refactoring"] },

Deep learning-based code search methods demonstrate superior performance if models are trained with large amount of text-code pairs. However, few deep code search models can be easily transferred from one codebase to another. It can be very costly to prepare training data for a new codebase and re-train an appropriate deep learning model. In this paper, we propose AdaCS, an adaptive deep code search method that can be trained once and transferred to new codebases. AdaCS decomposes the learning process into embedding domain-specific words and matching general syntactic patterns. Firstly, an unsupervised word embedding technique is used to construct a matching matrix to represent the lexical similarities. Then, a recurrent neural network is used to capture latent syntactic patterns from these matching matrices in a supervised way. As the supervised task learns general syntactic patterns that exist across domains, AdaCS is transferable to new codebases.

To address this problem, Jiang et al. proposed an approach (we refer to it as NMT), which leverages a neural machine translation algorithm to automatically generate short commit messages from code. The reported performance of their approach is promising, however, they did not explore why their approach performs well. Thus, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of their experimental results.

However, when changing code, developers sometimes neglect updating the related comments, bringing in inconsistent or obsolete comments (aka., bad comments). Such comments are detrimental since they may mislead developers and lead to future bugs. Therefore, it is necessary to fix and avoid bad comments. In this work, we argue that bad comments can be reduced and even avoided by automatically performing comment updates with code changes. We refer to this task as “Just-In-Time (JIT) Comment Updating” and propose an approach named CUP (Comment UPdater) to automate this task. CUP can be used to assist developers in updating comments during code changes and can consequently help avoid the introduction of bad comments. Specifically, CUP leverages a novel neural sequence-to-sequence model to learn comment update patterns from extant code-comment co-changes and can automatically generate a new comment based on its corresponding old comment and code change. Several customized enhancements, such as a special tokenizer and a novel co-attention mechanism, are introduced in CUP by us to handle the characteristics of this task. We build a dataset with over 108K comment-code co-change samples and evaluate CUP on it. The evaluation results show that CUP outperforms an information-retrieval-based and a rule-based baselines by substantial margins, and can reduce developers’ edits required for JIT comment updating.

To address this problem, we introduce the notion of comment entailment from code, high entailment indicating that a comment’s natural language semantics can be inferred directly from the code. Although not all entailed comments are low quality, comments that are too easily inferred, for example, comments that restate the code, are widely discouraged by authorities on software style. Based on this, we develop a tool called CRAIC which scores method-level comments for redundancy. Highly redundant comments can then be expanded or alternately removed by the developer. CRAIC uses deep language models to exploit large software corpora without requiring expensive manual annotations of entailment. We show that CRAIC can perform the comment entailment task with good agreement with human judgements. Our findings also have implications for documentation tools.

STYLE-ANALYZER can then suggest style inconsistency fixes in the form of code review comments. We evaluate the output quality and practical relevance of STYLE-ANALYZER by demonstrating that it can reproduce the original style with high precision, measured on 19 popular JavaScript projects, and by showing that it yields promising results in fixing real style mistakes. STYLE-ANALYZER includes a web application to visualize how the rules are triggered.

Code clone detection plays an important role in software maintenance, code refactoring, and reuse. A substantial amount of research has been conducted in the past to detect clones. A majority of these approaches use lexical and syntactic information to detect clones. However, only a few of them target semantic clones. Recently, motivated by the success of deep learning models in other fields, including natural language processing and computer vision, researchers have attempted to adopt deep learning techniques to detect code clones. These approaches use lexical information (tokens) and(or) syntactic structures like abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to detect code clones. However, they do not make sufficient use of the available structural and semantic information hence, limiting their capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>This paper addresses the problem of semantic code clone detection using program dependency graphs and geometric neural networks, leveraging the structured syntactic and semantic information.

Accurate similarity estimation between programs requires an in-depth understanding of their structure, semantics and flow. A control flow graph (CFG), is a graphical representation of a program which captures its logical control flow and hence its semantics. A common approach is to estimate program similarity by analysing CFGs using graph similarity measures, e.g. graph edit distance (GED). However, graph edit distance is an NP-hard problem and computationally expensive, making the application of graph similarity techniques to complex software programs impractical. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of graph neural networks to estimate program similarity, by analysing the associated control flow graphs.

To our knowledge, this is the first time graph neural networks have been applied on labeled CFGs for estimating the similarity between high-level language programs. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness of funcGNN to estimate the GED between programs and our experimental analysis demonstrates how it achieves a lower error rate (0.00194), with faster (23 times faster than the quickest traditional GED approximation method) and better scalability compared with the state of the art methods. funcGNN posses the inductive learning ability to infer program structure and generalise to unseen programs.

Our goal is to combine logical constraints, that is, deterministic information from a type system, with natural constraints, uncertain information about types from sources like identifier names. To this end, we introduce a framework for probabilistic type inference that combines logic and learning: logical constraints on the types are extracted from the program, and deep learning is applied to predict types from surface-level code properties that are statistically associated, such as variable names. The main insight of our method is to constrain the predictions from the learning procedure to respect the logical constraints, which we achieve by relaxing the logical inference problem of type prediction into a continuous optimisation problem. To evaluate the idea, we built a tool called OptTyper to predict a TypeScript declaration file for a JavaScript library. OptTyper combines a continuous interpretation of logical constraints derived by a simple program transformation and static analysis of the JavaScript code, with natural constraints obtained from a deep learning model, which learns naming conventions for types from a large codebase. We evaluate OptTyper on a data set of 5,800 open-source JavaScript projects that have type annotations in the well-known DefinitelyTyped repository.

Recent works that learn representations of code based on pre-training techniques in NLP have pushed the frontiers in this direction. However, the semantics of PL and NL have essential differences. These being ignored, we believe it is difficult to build a model to better understand programs, by either directly applying off-the-shelf NLP pre-training techniques to the source code, or adding features to the model by the heuristic. In fact, the semantics of a program can be rigorously defined by formal semantics in PL theory. For example, the operational semantics, describes the meaning of a valid program as updating the environment (i.e., the memory address-value function) through fundamental operations, such as memory I/O and conditional branching. Inspired by this, we propose a novel program semantics learning paradigm, that the model should learn from information composed of (1) the representations which align well with the fundamental operations in operational semantics, and (2) the information of environment transition, which is indispensable for program understanding. To validate our proposal, we present a hierarchical Transformer-based pre-training model called OSCAR to better facilitate the understanding of programs.

Unfortunately, static type inference for dynamic languages is inherently limited, while probabilistic approaches suffer from imprecision. This paper presents TypeWriter, the first combination of probabilistic prediction with search-based refinement of predicted types. TypeWriter’s predictor learns to infer the return and argument types for functions from partially annotated code bases by combining the natural language properties of code with programming language-level information. To validate predicted types, TypeWriter invokes a gradual type checker with different combinations of the predicted types, while navigating the space of possible type combinations in a feedback-directed manner. We implement the TypeWriter approach for Python and evaluate it on two code corpora: a multi-million line code base at Facebook and a collection of 500 popular open-source projects. We show that TypeWriter’s type predictor achieves a precision of 64% (91%) and a recall of 52% (68%) in the top-1 (top-5) predictions, and demonstrate that usage contexts are a helpful addition to neural type predictors. By combining predictions with search-based validation, TypeWriter can fully annotate between 42% to 64% of the files in a randomly selected corpus, while ensuring type correctness.

We propose a new approach to leverage user feedback to guide program analyses towards true alarms and away from false alarms. Our approach associates each alarm with a confidence value by performing Bayesian inference on a probabilistic model derived from the analysis rules. In each iteration, the user inspects the alarm with the highest confidence and labels its ground truth, and the approach recomputes the confidences of the remaining alarms given this feedback. It thereby maximizes the return on the effort by the user in inspecting each alarm. We have implemented our approach in a tool named Bingo for program analyses expressed in Datalog.

{"key": "rahman2019natural", "year": "2019", "title":"Natural Software Revisited", "abstract": "<p>Recent works have concluded that software is more repetitive and predictable, i.e. more natural, than English texts. These works included “simple/artificial” syntax rules in their language models. When we remove SyntaxTokens we find that code is still repetitive and predictable but only at levels slightly above English. Furthermore, previous works have compared individual Java programs to general English corpora, such as Gutenberg, which contains a historically large range of styles and subjects (e.g. Saint Augustine to Oscar Wilde). We perform an additional comparison of technical StackOverflow English discussions with source code and find that this restricted English is similarly repetitive to code. Although we find that code is less repetitive than previously thought, we suspect that API code element usage will be repetitive across software projects. For example a file is opened and closed in the same manner irrespective of domain. When we restrict our n-grams to those contained in the Java API we find that the entropy is significantly lower than the English corpora. Previous works have focused on sequential sequences of tokens. When we extract program graphs of size 2, 3, and 4 nodes we see that the abstract graph representation is much more concise and repetitive than the sequential representations of the same code. This suggests that future work should focus on statistical graph models that go beyond linear sequences of tokens.

Most popular fuzzers use evolutionary guidance to generate inputs that can trigger different bugs. Such evolutionary algorithms, while fast and simple to implement, often get stuck in fruitless sequences of random mutations. Gradient-guided optimization presents a promising alternative to evolutionary guidance. Gradient-guided techniques have been shown to significantly outperform evolutionary algorithms at solving high-dimensional structured optimization problems in domains like machine learning by efficiently utilizing gradients or higher-order derivatives of the underlying function. However, gradient-guided approaches are not directly applicable to fuzzing as real-world program behaviors contain many discontinuities, plateaus, and ridges where the gradient-based methods often get stuck.

However, such embedding method learned two isolated representations for code and query but ignored their internal semantic correlations. As a result, the learned isolated representations of code and query may limit the effectiveness of code search.</p>\n\n<p>To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a co-attentive representation learning model, i.e., Co-Attentive Representation Learning Code Search-CNN (CARLCS-CNN). CARLCS-CNN learns interdependent representations for the embedded code and query with a co-attention mechanism. Generally, such mechanism learns a correlation matrix between embedded code and query, and co-attends their semantic relationship via row/column-wise max-pooling. In this way, the semantic correlation between code and query can directly affect their individual representations. We evaluate the effectiveness of CARLCS-CNN on Gu et al.’s dataset with 10k queries. Experimental results show that the proposed CARLCS-CNN model significantly outperforms DeepCS by 26.72% in terms of MRR (mean reciprocal rank). Additionally, CARLCS-CNN is five times faster than DeepCS in model training and four times in testing.</p>\n", "tags": ["search"] },

A model has to be trained for every prompt/question separately, which in turn requires graded samples. In automatic programming evaluation specifically, the focus of this work, this issue is amplified. The models have to be trained not only for every question but also for every language the question is offered in. Moreover, the availability and time taken by experts to create a labeled set of programs for each question is a major bottleneck in scaling such a system. We address this issue by presenting a method to grade computer programs which requires no manually assigned labeled samples for grading responses to a new, unseen question. We extend our previous work (by Srikant, Aggarwal; KDD 2014) wherein we introduced a grammar of features to learn question specific models. In this work, we propose a method to transform those features into a set of features that maintain their structural relation with the labels across questions. Using these features we learn one supervised model, across questions for a given language, which can then be applied to an ungraded response to an unseen question. We show that our method rivals the performance of both, question specific models and the consensus among human experts while substantially outperforming extant ways of evaluating codes. We demonstrate the system single s value by deploying it to grade programs in a high stakes assessment.

Code review has been widely used for both industry and open-source projects due to its capacity in early defect identification, project maintenance, and code improvement. With rapid updates on project developments, code review becomes a non-trivial and labor-intensive task for reviewers. Thus, an automated code review engine can be beneficial and useful for project development in practice. Although there exist prior studies on automating the code review process by adopting static analysis tools or deep learning techniques, they often require external sources such as partial or full source code for accurate review suggestion. In this paper, we aim at automating the code review process only based on code changes and the corresponding reviews but with better performance. The hinge of accurate code review suggestion is to learn good representations for both code changes and reviews. To achieve this with limited source, we design a multi-level embedding (i.e., word embedding and character embedding) approach to represent the semantics provided by code changes and reviews. The embeddings are then well trained through a proposed attentional deep learning model, as a whole named CORE. We evaluate the effectiveness of CORE on code changes and reviews collected from 19 popular Java projects hosted on Github. Experimental results show that our model CORE can achieve significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art model (DeepMem), with an increase of 131.03% in terms of Recall@10 and 150.69% in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank.

In addition to grading a program on its programming practices and complexity, the key kernel of the system is a machine-learning based algorithm which determines closeness of the logic of the given program to a correct program. This algorithm uses a set of highly-informative features, derived from the abstract representations of a given program, that capture the program’s functionality.

The major reason is due to the semantic diversity and mismatch between queries and code snippets. Deep learning models have been proposed to address this challenge. Compared with approaches using information retrieval techniques, deep learning models do not suffer from the information loss caused by refining user intention into keywords. However, the performance of previous works is not satisfactory because they ignore the importance of code structure. When the semantics of code (e.g., identifier names, APIs) are ambiguous, code structure may be the only feature for the model to utilize. In that case, previous works relearn the structural information from lexical tokens of code, which is extremely difficult for a model without any domain knowledge.

To the best of our knowledge, most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework which encodes the code into a hidden space and then decode it into natural language space, suffering from two major drawbacks: a) Their encoders only consider the sequential content of code, ignoring the tree structure which is also critical for the task of code summarization; b) Their decoders are typically trained to predict the next word by maximizing the likelihood of next ground-truth word with previous ground-truth word given. However, it is expected to generate the entire sequence from scratch at test time. This discrepancy can cause an exposure bias issue, making the learnt decoder suboptimal. In this paper, we incorporate an abstract syntax tree structure as well as sequential content of code snippets into a deep reinforcement learning framework (i.e., actor-critic network). The actor network provides the confidence of predicting the next word according to current state. On the other hand, the critic network evaluates the reward value of all possible extensions of the current state and can provide global guidance for explorations. We employ an advantage reward composed of BLEU metric to train both networks.

In this paper, we explore two global context information, namely intra-class and inter-class context information, and propose the model CoCoGUM: Contextual Code Summarization with Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks on UMLs. CoCoGUM first incorporates class names as the intra-class context, which is further fed to a Transformer-based sentence embedding model to extract the class lexical embeddings. Then, relevant Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams are extracted as inter-class context and we use a Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network (MR-GNN) to encode the class relational embeddings.

Numerous approaches of detecting code clones have been proposed previously, but most of them focus on detecting syntactic clones and do not work well on semantic clones with different syntactic features. To detect semantic clones, researchers have tried to adopt deep learning for code clone detection to automatically learn latent semantic features from data. Especially, to leverage grammar information, several approaches used abstract syntax trees (AST) as input and achieved significant progress on code clone benchmarks in various programming languages. However, these AST-based approaches still can not fully leverage the structural information of code fragments, especially semantic information such as control flow and data flow. To leverage control and data flow information, in this paper, we build a graph representation of programs called flow-augmented abstract syntax tree (FA-AST). We construct FA-AST by augmenting original ASTs with explicit control and data flow edges. Then we apply two different types of graph neural networks (GNN) on FA-AST to measure the similarity of code pairs.

Based on this observation, we exploit a hierarchical attention network to learn the representation of methods. Specifically, we apply two-level attention mechanism to learn the importance of each token in a basic block and that of a basic block in a method respectively.

The overlaps between different names used by different people indicate that two different names may be potentially related (e.g., “message” and “msg”), and the overlaps between identifiers in code and words in natural language descriptions indicate that the code snippet and the description may potentially be related. To address these problems, we propose a novel neural architecture named OCoR, where we introduce two specifically-designed components to capture overlaps: the first embeds identifiers by character to capture the overlaps between identifiers, and the second introduces a novel overlap matrix to represent the degrees of overlaps between each natural language word and each identifier.\nThe evaluation was conducted on two established datasets. The experimental results show that OCoR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves 13.1% to 22.3% improvements. Moreover, we also conducted several in-depth experiments to help understand the performance of different components in OCoR.</p>\n", "tags": ["search"] },

Recent APR techniques use deep learning, particularly the encoder-decoder architecture, to generate patches.\nThough existing DL-based APR approaches have proposed different encoder architectures, the decoder remains to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of tokens one by one to replace the faulty statement.\nThis decoder has multiple limitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs, 2) inefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to generate project-specific identifiers.\nIn this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder with placeholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects: 1) Recoder generates edits rather than modified code, allowing efficient representation of small edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided, with the novel provider/decider architecture to ensure the syntactic correctness of the patched program and accurate generation; 3) Recoder generates placeholders that could be instantiated as project-specific identifiers later.\nWe conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2, 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, 297 bugs from IntroClassJava and 40 bugs from QuixBugs. Our results show that Recoder repairs 53 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves 26.2% (11 bugs) improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach for single-hunk bugs (TBar). Importantly, to our knowledge, Recoder is the first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed the traditional APR approaches on this benchmark.</p>\n", "tags": ["edit"] },
{"key": "zugner2021language", "year": "2021", "title":"Language-Agnostic Representation Learning of Source Code from Structure and Context", "abstract": "<p>Source code (Context) and its parsed abstract syntax tree (AST; Structure) are two complementary representations of the same computer program. Traditionally, designers of machine learning models have relied predominantly either on Structure or Context. We propose a new model, which jointly learns on Context and Structure of source code. In contrast to previous approaches, our model uses only language-agnostic features, i.e., source code and features that can be computed directly from the AST. Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model. We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages. Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code.</p>\n", "tags": ["Transformer","representation"] }
